# StretchSense, iOS Library  

StretchSense is a global supplier of soft sensors. These soft sensors are perfect for measuring the complex movements of people and soft objects in our environments. 

## About
### Background
The StretchSense iOS API has been developed to demonstrate how to establish a connection between a one or more StretchSense Fabric Evaluation circuits and a BLE enabled iOS device. The platform was developed using XCode 7.3 with Swift 2.2.
This project and additional examples are available on StretchSense's Github Page http://github.com/Stretchsense.

### Usage
The StretchSense iOS API includes a Library.swift file which can be included in an iOS developed project to enable BLE communications with a StretchSense Fabric Evaluation circuit. The API also includes two example projects that demonstrate the usage of the library when connecting either a single or multiple circuits simultaneously.
